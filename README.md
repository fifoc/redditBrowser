OC reddit browser built on top of Fif

# Getting it working

This repo contains 2 things: 
.lua files
.go files

Go files are the special image server needed  to convert reddit .png to .fif

The viewer has a variable that defines what server to use, so you probably don't need the server yourself unless you don't trust me.

There is also .lua files (libfif.lua and redditViewer.lua)

They are the viewer.

Install OpenOS on a computer, download these 2 files into /home and run redditViewer. You're done and can now browse reddit with OC!
